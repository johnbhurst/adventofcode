# F#

Run these projects using the `dotnet` command, like this:

``` bash
dotnet run ../../day1_input.txt
```

My original inputs from when I did the puzzles in Haskell are in 2021/.

Since I've resumed these in F#, I logged in using GitHub. I don't recall how I logged in previously, but I am getting different inputs now. The new GitHub-linked inputs are in the folders under 2021/fsharp/.
